# Milestone-Project-1-User-Centric-Front-End-Development

The project is a static website for a real-life small car and motorbike repairs and motor trader business. The purpose of this project is to introduce the garage and its services, to serve as a platform for advertising the items on sale and to generate more business.

## UX
The target audience is private individuals looking for a reliable local garage for repairs, advice or used cars and motorbikes. This website is easy to navigate, provides all essential information for the visitor to be able to decide whether they want to take the next step and contact the business. The website invites visitors to get in touch and offers them multiple options, including links to other sites like Facebook or Ebay. 

The layout and colour scheme are similar on all 3 pages. It features the same background image  with a white header on top and black footer on the bottom.

The website is responsive, on medium and small viewports the telephone number is hidden from the header and on small wiewports the menu items are stacked below the company logo. The content also shrinks to fit the current viewport width.

### User stories

* As User 1 I would be looking for a new mechanic to carry out the annual MOT service. I visit the website in order to get an impression of the garage and its services.

* As User 2 I would like to find a local car dealership in order to buy a car from a reliable source.

* As User 3 I am looking for a part for my car so that I can fix it myself.

## Deployment

My website is currently deployed on Github Pages - https://kittikovacs.github.io/milestone1/ directly from the master branch.

I used Repl.it for testing new ideas or small changes as I find Gitpod is not really suitable for this purpose.

I deployed the project to GitHub in small increments. I did a lot of research on positioning to make the website responsive which took up most of my time during development process, as well as optimizing image sizes. I used Chrome developer tools extensively to help me throughout the process.
